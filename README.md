## Software Design
### Food Recipes
When it comes to food, you should not say 'Live to eat' instead say 'Eat to live'.

There is a different kind of recipes in the app that helps the user to make delicious food by providing them accurate ingredients and all the necessary steps needed to make a delicious food item.
